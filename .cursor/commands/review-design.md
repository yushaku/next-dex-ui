Review the design documentation in docs/ai/design/feature-{name}.md (and the project-level README if relevant). Summarize:
- Architecture overview (ensure mermaid diagram is present and accurate)
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Technology choices and rationale
- Data models and relationships
- API/interface contracts (inputs, outputs, auth)
- Major design decisions and trade-offs
- Non-functional requirements that must be preserved

Highlight any inconsistencies, missing sections, or diagrams that need updates.
