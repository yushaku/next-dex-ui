# Testing Strategy

## Test Coverage Goals
**What level of testing do we aim for?**

- Unit test coverage target (default: 100% of new/changed code)
- Integration test scope (critical paths + error handling)
- End-to-end test scenarios (key user journeys)
- Alignment with requirements/design acceptance criteria

## Unit Tests
**What individual components need testing?**

### Component/Module 1
- [ ] Test case 1: [Description] (covers scenario / branch)
- [ ] Test case 2: [Description] (covers edge case / error handling)
- [ ] Additional coverage: [Description]

### Component/Module 2
- [ ] Test case 1: [Description]
- [ ] Test case 2: [Description]
- [ ] Additional coverage: [Description]

## Integration Tests
**How do we test component interactions?**

- [ ] Integration scenario 1
- [ ] Integration scenario 2
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Integration scenario 3 (failure mode / rollback)

## End-to-End Tests
**What user flows need validation?**

- [ ] User flow 1: [Description]
- [ ] User flow 2: [Description]
- [ ] Critical path testing
- [ ] Regression of adjacent features

## Test Data
**What data do we use for testing?**

- Test fixtures and mocks
- Seed data requirements
- Test database setup

## Test Reporting & Coverage
**How do we verify and communicate test results?**

- Coverage commands and thresholds (`npm run test -- --coverage`)
- Coverage gaps (files/functions below 100% and rationale)
- Links to test reports or dashboards
- Manual testing outcomes and sign-off

## Manual Testing
**What requires human validation?**

- UI/UX testing checklist (include accessibility)
- Browser/device compatibility
- Smoke tests after deployment

## Performance Testing
**How do we validate performance?**

- Load testing scenarios
- Stress testing approach
- Performance benchmarks

## Bug Tracking
**How do we manage issues?**

- Issue tracking process
- Bug severity levels
- Regression testing strategy
