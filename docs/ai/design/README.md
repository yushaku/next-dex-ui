# System Design & Architecture

## Architecture Overview
**What is the high-level system structure?**

- Include a mermaid diagram that captures the main components and their relationships. Example:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    Client -->|HTTPS| API
    API --> ServiceA
    API --> ServiceB
    ServiceA --> Database[(DB)]
  ```
- Key components and their responsibilities
- Technology stack choices and rationale

## Data Models
**What data do we need to manage?**

- Core entities and their relationships
- Data schemas/structures
- Data flow between components

## API Design
**How do components communicate?**

- External APIs (if applicable)
- Internal interfaces
- Request/response formats
- Authentication/authorization approach

## Component Breakdown
**What are the major building blocks?**

- Frontend components (if applicable)
- Backend services/modules
- Database/storage layer
- Third-party integrations

## Design Decisions
**Why did we choose this approach?**

- Key architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Alternatives considered
- Patterns and principles applied

## Non-Functional Requirements
**How should the system perform?**

- Performance targets
- Scalability considerations
- Security requirements
- Reliability/availability needs
